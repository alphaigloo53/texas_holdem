     <h1>Texas Hold'em Poker</h1>
     <p>Texas Hold'em is the most commonly played version of poker in the world. It's the 
        main game played in major poker tournaments, or amongst friends to win a little extra cash.
        Each player is dealt two cards, and the goal is to build the best possible hand with
        five cards that are played in the river (all players are allowed to use these five cards to build their hand).
