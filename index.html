     <h1>Texas Hold'em Poker</h1>
     <p>Texas Hold'em is the most commonly played version of poker in the world. It's the 
        main game played in major poker tournaments, or amongst friends to win a little extra cash.
        Each player is dealt two cards, and the goal is to build the best possible hand with
        five cards that are played in the river (all players are allowed to use these five cards to build their hand).

     <h2>Rules</h2>
     <p>Again, the goal is to create the best 5 card hand using your two cards and the river of five cards.</p>

     <ul>
        <li>Each player gets two cards</li>
        <li>Five community cards are shared</li>
        <li>You may use any five cards to make a hand</li>
     </ul>

     <h4>Betting Rounds</h4>
     <p>There are four betting rounds.</p>
     
     <!--Here I am using an ordered list to show the user some more attributes of poker. Below I also use an unordered list
     to do the same thing-->
     <ol>
        <li>Pre-Flop: After cards are dealt</li>
        <li>Flop: First three cards are revealed</li>
        <li>Turn: Fourth community card is revealed</li>
        <li>River: Fifth community card is revealed</li>
     </ol>

     <h4>Betting Actions</h4>
    <p>Each round, players have optins on what they can do based on their strategy and cards.</p>
    <p>Players may:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Check: Pass the action</li>
        <li>Bet: Put desired chips in to increase the amount of funds at stake</li>
        <li>Call: Match the current bet</li>
        <li>Raise: Increase the bet</li>
        <li>Fold: Give up the hand</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You must do one of these actions each turn. Each choice comes with different playstyles and strategies, but the idea of this page
        is just to get the basics down and learn how the flow of the game works.
